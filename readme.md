# Ensolvers - Interview Assigment
This application was made as a resolution for the problem presented by the Ensolvers team. For activating the code we asume that Node.JS is installed

This project was made with React and NodeJS and using PostgreSQL as the Backend. A few hours ago the project was working at 80% of phase 1, with just a few bugs around the filter. The project was made with the intention of being able to be deployed in a server, so the code is not optimized for local use.

Also, the latest tinkering trying to solve the filter problem brought the API interactions down. Eventhough I hope to fix them, since I'm really outside the scope of time I'm presenting this project now, with the intention of being able to be reviewed.
